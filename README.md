## The data for the inventory and such is managed through a local Microsoft SQL database. In order to use this program as is, you will need to download the SQL files located in the 'Database' folder, put them in your project, and change the directory location to a local directory in your own location.
## A readme file containing the steps to connect the database is attached in the 'Database' folder, along with the four SQL files you will need to build your database.
### This is a management system application for a store that sells computer parts.
### Currently, there are only two CPUs and one GPU in the inventory. 
### The code for the program is based on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4YHCa92BdM&ab_channel=MyCodeSpace.
### Tweaks and changes are made according to program needs.
